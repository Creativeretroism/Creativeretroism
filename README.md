# So what am i doing here :question:

</div>

What are we ALL doing here? Collaborating together and stealing each others code ... with the best intentions of course!

I'm here to fuel my interests and be creative! :paintbrush:

Ever get that feeling that no matter how much you experience something, it just feels the same? Yeah, same... 

This is why being creative and trying to methods and techniques is so important; push the boundaries. Don't just think outside the box; Take the box apart and make something else.
